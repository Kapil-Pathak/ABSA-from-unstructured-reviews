34524,"Classic Brands Cool Ventilated Gel Memory Foam 8-Inch Mattress, Full, White",02 Mar 2018,"Size: Full | 
            
             Style Name: 8"" Cool Gel Mattress Only Classic Brands Ventilated 8-inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is the latest technology in memory foam mattresses. One layer of 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam draws heat away from your body and allows breathability. The second layer beneath consists of 6 inches of high-density memory foam that conforms to your body providing support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment for a great night's sleep. Perfect for kid’s rooms, college dorms, and guest rooms, this mattress is a great value for any room in the house. The Cool Gel 8-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress and it’s adjustable base friendly. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

The mattress simply does not provide sufficient support.  I did not have these issues with my prior mattress (which was a cheap coil that we had for two years).  I bought this only because my prior mattress was a full size and I wanted a little more room.  Husband hates this mattress and says he feels like he is falling off the side.

Just as everyone else said, the box looked like it was blown up several times, but the mattress arrive damage free. It was fun to unbox it, and watch it expand. The first thing I noticed is the mattress feels so cold, it almost feels wet. After 24 hours of letting it set up, I slept on it. It’s maybe slightly on the firm side at first, now after a month it’s slightly less firm but still extremely plush. I sleep like a rock, and I find myself having to force myself to get up as it’s just that comfortable. That’s good and bad I guess, but I’ll say I’ve never had a mattress that has had that effect on me. I also have bad back problems, but I find the more I sleep on it, the less pain I feel in the mornings. Buy it. You’ll love it.",5.0,lucid

After awhile, the sleep number started leaking and got wore out. My daughter had bought one of these about 9 months prior and when she noticed that it was on sale, she called me. I love this mattress. And it works well with the adjustable base that we already had. They came in two boxes and were compressed really well. Open the box, unroll the plastic covering and give it some space. It bounces in to shape pretty quick. I waited about an hour before putting them on my bed.  I had a question, so I called the mattress customer service. Someone picked up the phone and answered all of my questions. No waiting, no foreigners, no phone systems, an actual person. The lady answered all of my questions. And what I really liked was that if I wasn't satisfied, they donate the used mattress to charity.

I've owned a couple of foam mattresses before, and this one is a bit firmer than some and feels like it will last longer.  Time will tell. It takes a few days for the corners to fill out completely into its natural shape.  Unlike many foam mattresses, this one was not notably smelly.  Some of them you have to leave for days or a week.  One full day was enough to make me feel okay about using it.  Nevertheless, I gave it an extra few days just to feel safe.  Sometimes what you don't see CAN hurt you! I'd still recommend a couple of inches of foam mattress topper, for stain protection without using a rubber mattress protector.  You want these things to be able to air out fully, or they can develop mold or fungus underneath. Similarly, if you wind up spilling a cup of coffee in bed one day, you want something to absorb it before it hits the mattress proper.  Sheets alone might not do.  Then you'd have to worry how long the mattress foam would hold that liquid, or simply some humidity from it long after it would seem to have dried out. Additionally, I ordered a sheet of moisture-barrier material to put underneath so as to create a space for air to circulate.  They sell it in 39 inch wide rolls you cut to match your needs.  I'll need two sheets for the 80x60 dimensions of a standard queen bed.  There are several different brand names for essentially the same thing -- something with stiff plastic wires on one side and a piece of fabric on the other to protect the mattress.  This is especially important in a closed and generally humid space like an RV, but I had a mold problem under the bed I used in my house, too -- a place that otherwise has never had mold anywhere at all.  It's the active use that does it.",5.0,signature sleep

I wanted a gel mattress because I needed something that stays cool and this mattress does the job. Since it's been cooler this past week, I just leave my window open for about half an hour before I go to bed and the breeze cools it down quite a bit. I love soft mattresses and the reviews for this mattress said it was plush so I was surprised to see that it was a lot firmer than I thought it would be. I just add some plush blankets to fix that and it's very comfortable after that.",5.0,lucid

The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

It may also trap heat that needs to escape.|Don’t use dry cleaning fluid of any type on your mattress. These chemicals could damage some of the comfort and upholstery materials.|Vacuuming is the only recommended cleaning method. If you must clean a stain use mild soap with cold water and apply lightly allowing the mattress time to fully air dry.|Please remind the kids not to jump on their Ashley-Sleep mattress as doing so can break down the inner construction and materials.","Ok so I am trying to come up with a negative for this review and honestly I cant find one.

So it arrived perfectly on time and no damage to the package even though it was very large and I expected some wear and tear to the box . It unboxed perfectly, no odor and after an about 2 hours (by 6 pm) was pretty much up about 11 inches, so I put sheets on it and then stared at it for another 4 hours waiting to crawl into my pretty new bed and test it out. I felt much like the medium density Hybrid mattress I had tried in the local stores and no complaints there. My first night i woke in the morning without much back pain and since that's what prompted me to finally get a new mattress after 10 years or so I was pleased. It not magic I am getting older and still have a few aches and pains here but overall a vast improvement. For the price it was more than I could have hoped for.

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

Gel foam helps regulate temperature throughout the mattress. A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming Response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress- free support. This can allow the spine to stay in a neutral position. Should you move during the night, your partner is never disturbed due to the lack of reciprocal movement between sleeping partners. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture. individually wrapped coil support base the support base in our Hybrid mattresses consists of innerspring individual coils wrapped in a fabric designed to minimize friction and maximize support.

So then they told me to find someone to give it to and get some paperwork signed. I did. Not so easy to find someone who wants a used mattress and will pick it up!!!

             Style: Cool Gel 1.0 Mattress Only The latest in memory foam and gel technology, Classic Brands 10-Inch Cool Gel Mattress draws heat away from your body so that you stay comfortable at night without tossing and turning. Gel particles are infused throughout the memory foam to help regulate mattress temperature and the memory foam conforms to your body reducing pressure points in any sleeping position and properly aligns the spine. The Classic Brands Cool Gel Mattress has Gel-Infused Memory Foam and is designed for the ultimate in comfort and support. Starting with breathable 2-inch Cool Gel memory foam, this layer disperses body heat and creates a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Two 1-inch layers of Poly Gel-Supportive Foam provides support for the Gel Foam layer. The 6.5-inch support base layer maintains the strength and effectiveness of all three layers. Covered with a beautifully detailed knit top and charcoal-grey knit sides for breathability, the four-way stretch conforms to your body for comfort working with the top layer of gel memory foam to optimize its contouring properties. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a cooler sleeping surface. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products.

At first it was great but after only 4 years the cheap foam they install under the emery foam has broken down causing deep dips in the mattress. I now have to see a chiropractor due to the bed which is contrary to why we had purchased it in the 1st place. We filed a warranty claim and it was denied within 5 minutes online.

             Style Name: 6-Inch Cool Gel Mattress The Classic Brands Cool Gel 6-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air is able to travel throughout the material and actually dissipate body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally antimicrobial and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment.

             Style Name: 8"" Cool Gel Mattress Only Classic Brands Ventilated 8-inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is the latest technology in memory foam mattresses. One layer of 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam draws heat away from your body and allows breathability. The second layer beneath consists of 6 inches of high-density memory foam that conforms to your body providing support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment for a great night's sleep. Perfect for kid’s rooms, college dorms, and guest rooms, this mattress is a great value for any room in the house. The Cool Gel 8-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress and it’s adjustable base friendly. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested.

Our durable, flexible mattress provides all the support and comfort needed for a good night’s rest, while being lightweight and firm. This 6 inch foam mattress is perfect for cots, daybeds, guest beds, roll out trundles, RV bunks, futons, on top of a frame extender, camping, or even for on the floor sleepovers! Made with 3 pounds of high density foam, this Fortnight mattress, has a firm feel that is not too hard and not too soft! For your safety, our foam is always made in the US and is CertiPur-US certified, so it contains no PBDEs, TDCPP or TCEP (""Tris"") flame retardants, ozone depleters, mercury, formaldehyde, lead and heavy metals. Why Foam?: Foam mattresses are known for their supportive construction. Being firmer than a traditional mattress, they are suitable for those who suffer from back pain and other related issues. A soft mattress will provide no support and can make you feel uncomfortable. If you’re looking to avoid the “sunk in” feeling of a memory foam mattress, the compact construction of this foam mattress will bounce back after applying pressure. Before Ordering: Accurate measurements of your bed frame are vital to ensure your new mattress fits precisely. The firm structure of our high-density foam mattresses are perfect for those with a heavier build. We recommend that those who have a heavier build purchase a 4 inch or thicker mattress to ensure the most restful and comfortable sleep is achievable. Setup: Mattress comes conveniently right to your door in a box! They are compressed and rolled in a box so it’s easy to transport and set up. After your mattress arrives, simply remove it from the box and remove the plastic, being careful not to cut into the mattress. Allow 24-48 hours for your new mattress to decompress and return to its original plush shape.",mattress used on day bed and with mattress cover is a vast improvement over the mattress that came with the bed.,5.0,fortnight

             Style Name: 8"" Cool Gel Mattress Only Classic Brands Ventilated 8-inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is the latest technology in memory foam mattresses. One layer of 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam draws heat away from your body and allows breathability. The second layer beneath consists of 6 inches of high-density memory foam that conforms to your body providing support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment for a great night's sleep. Perfect for kid’s rooms, college dorms, and guest rooms, this mattress is a great value for any room in the house. The Cool Gel 8-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress and it’s adjustable base friendly. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

30230,Pure Green Natural Latex Mattress - Soft - Queen,02 Aug 2019,,"Over the past year I have tried 5 mattresses, yes 5!!! All of them had issues, either too hot, too hard or a horrible smell. I tried a traditional spring, all foam and a spring/latex combo. To say I was nervous ordering this was an understatement. I ordered the soft king size mattress and also decided to take the advice of another reviewer and I ordered the 2"" soft topper to put on top of the mattress. It is heaven and made the mattress close to 11"" which was nice to have it a little taller. ! I unzipped the cover and put the topper inside so that the cotton/wool cover is closest to my body. I am a side sleeper and weigh about 200lbs so I needed something soft but supportive and this mattress is both. It took me a couple of weeks to adjust to the mattress but once I did it was great. The only small cons I would say are that if you sleep in all three positions it might be too soft for sleeping on your stomach.  The other small con is that it is heavy so definitely a two person job. It might have made sense to put two twin XL's together and then the king 2"" topper on top to make it easier to move but I will just get help when I need to move it!  The smell was not strong to me and I do have a sensitive nose.",4.0,pure green

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

I've been sleeping late, just don't want to get up. I researched a lot of these foam mattresses and have no buyers remorse whatsoever on my decision.",5.0,classic brands

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

             Style: 2018 Model Product Description From the Manufacturer","My brother received an email over Memorial Day Weekend that promised a $200 Amazon gift card for a referral of a friend who purchases a mattress. I am moving homes and was in the market for a mattress so he let me know about the deal and I decided to take advantage of the deal that came with it (10% off) and also get my brother a gift card. I ordered the mattress and a foundation and then my brother heard nothing about the gift card after that whatsoever. We called to follow up and were told by Casper that the gift card was ""rejected"" by a third party that reviews their referrals. They told us there is absolutely nothing they can do and we could return the bed if we wanted to. This is just such unethical business practice. We were allured in by a deal and then it was rejected with no notice whatsoever. It's just wrong, wrong, wrong! Beware if you are referring anyone to Casper or taking advantage of a deal because you may not actually receive it and then will be left in a position of needing to decide whether to return on principle or just deal with it. So irritated with this purchase and I may still return it at this point. It even said something along the lines of ""you qualify for this deal' when I followed his link...how is this even legal to sell under a pretense and then not honor it.",1.0,casper

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

             Style: Cool Gel 1.0 Mattress Only The latest in memory foam and gel technology, Classic Brands 10-Inch Cool Gel Mattress draws heat away from your body so that you stay comfortable at night without tossing and turning. Gel particles are infused throughout the memory foam to help regulate mattress temperature and the memory foam conforms to your body reducing pressure points in any sleeping position and properly aligns the spine. The Classic Brands Cool Gel Mattress has Gel-Infused Memory Foam and is designed for the ultimate in comfort and support. Starting with breathable 2-inch Cool Gel memory foam, this layer disperses body heat and creates a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Two 1-inch layers of Poly Gel-Supportive Foam provides support for the Gel Foam layer. The 6.5-inch support base layer maintains the strength and effectiveness of all three layers. Covered with a beautifully detailed knit top and charcoal-grey knit sides for breathability, the four-way stretch conforms to your body for comfort working with the top layer of gel memory foam to optimize its contouring properties. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a cooler sleeping surface. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested.

I had a memory foam mattress previously, and I love the squishy sinking in feeling that those provide. But I was always sweating at night, and would wake up during the night with arm pain and tingling due to pinched nerves. I'm not positive, but I believe this was partially due to the fact that I am a side sleeper, and the memory foam allowed my body to push down onto my arms and pinch the nerves, due to not enough support in the mattress. For the record, I am 5'5"" and about 170 pounds, and do usually sleep on my side. I unpacked this mattress and let it sit for 24 hours before laying on it. Initially I thought it would be way too hard, because there is none of that wonderful sinking in feeling you get with memory foam. But after spending my first night on it, I am very happy. I slept all night through with no sweating and no arm tingling. I felt rested and had no hip pain which I do get if I sleep on a mattress that is too hard. I still have trouble getting used to the lack of the squishy sinking in feeling, but obviously it is only in my head, because I slept great on this thing. The mattress does have a nice bounce to it, yet doesn't seem like it would disturb anyone laying next to me if I moved or got out of bed.

One word FIBERGLASS, look it up and steer clear. The tag on my mattress cover DOES NOT list fiberglass as a material. There is a small description on this listing that states 2% fiberglass, but this could have been added AFTER I purchased my mattress. Whatever you do, DO NOT remove the cover or you'll be throwing out everything that comes into contact with these hazardous tiny fibers. Why would this company even put a zipper on the mattress cover if it's not removable? Shining a flashlight on your belongings will expose these tiny glass fibers but washing your linen only makes them embed further into fabrics. A class action lawsuit needs to be filed against company's who use these materials and company's who don't disclose these materials on the tags. Also, on the list of Do's and Do Not's in the warranty you would think it would state not to remove the tag. I called the company, and a male representative apprehensively confirmed that the sparkling strands were indeed fiberglass and told me to vacuum immediately. I had my mother call back a few hours later just to double check out of fear, and a female representative would not disclose any information about the material to her. VERY shady signature sleep! Fabrics wear down over time, so I'm sure the thin strands would've eventually made its way through the ""cover.""

Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture. individually wrapped coil support base the support base in our Hybrid mattresses consists of innerspring individual coils wrapped in a fabric designed to minimize friction and maximize support.

             Style: Nod Hybrid 10"" Nod Hybrid Mattress by Tuft & Needle Mattress, Bed in a Box, Responsive Foam, Sleeps Cooler & More Support Than Memory Foam, More Responsive Than Latex, CertiPUR US Certified, 10 Year Limited Warranty.","I was very excited to try this Nod Hybrid full size mattress. I’ve had coil spring mattresses, memory foam and cool gel memory foam but this was my first mattress with all the above—foam, gel and springs. My current mattress was a twelve inch memory foam and it slept very soft and I always felt like I was sinking in it. I definitely needed something with more support. The Nod mattress arrived in a tall box that thankfully had several handles I could use to drag it upstairs. It was hard to believe a full size mattress was in there. The mattress itself was covered in layers of plastic and as soon as I started cutting through them, I heard hissing and popping sounds as it expanded and I hurriedly had to remove the rest of the plastic.  The mattress was folded two ways to fit in the box. It reached its full ten inches in height in the first hour, but I wanted to let it sit unused over a day just in case. I did cheat and lied on it once before heading to my other bed that night and it was wonderful.  I didn’t detect any off smells with it. When I did start using the mattress, I noticed it was a bit firm the first night, but I was going from my soft mattress to this so it was expected. Over the next week or so I got used it very easily. Unlike memory foam alone, there’s a springiness to this mattress telling you it is a hybrid. You can feel the springs on the side of the mattress, but it’s not obvious when you’re sitting on the edge of the bed or anything.  I was just thrilled to not having that sinking feeling.  I felt no pressure point pain in my hips or shoulders  and have had no back pain mornings. I don’t feel the springs through the foam even while sleeping on my side and I am a side sleeper.  I am using a quilted mattress pad for an extra layer of protection and softness and I’m sure that does help. Time will tell if I continue to love this mattress. It takes at least a couple months before you can be truly sure how your body responds to it and I will update my review accordingly if my opinion changes or I find it’s just not meeting my expectations.  For now, I am very happy with it.",5.0,tuft & needle

127896,TEMPUR-Cloud Supreme,4/16/2018, ,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  Product is terrible after 2 years. Purchased mattress in August 2015 we were sold on the idea that the mattress would last longer than the typical 8-10 years.  We decided the """"investment"""" would be worth it if the product did everything the salesman said it would.  We felt comfortable with the 90 day trial giving us an opportunity to return if dissatisfied.  The mattress certainly took some getting used to, but for 2 years I slept comfortably.  On the contrary, my husband said he's never slept comfortably, but never complained because it was for me.  Interestingly enough, at the beginning of this year, January 2018, I would go to bed with no discomfort/back issues, but started to wake with low back pain.  As the months went on, it worsened.  It was only when I slept on this mattress that this discomfort occurred.  Filed a claim, but like other reviewers stated, they make it virtually impossible to get a replacement or for the company to honor their initial claims if you are dissatisfied.  ( I had original receipt, mattress cover(s), Law tag #, etc.) My bed was not """"sagging"""" when no one was on it.  Therefore, they said it did not meet their criteria.  The problem is they offer no way to test their """"pressure relieving qualities"""" which is where the problem stands.  Last night, the pain and discomfort was so excruciating, I got up and slept on my couch!  Again, once I'm out of the bed, my pain subsides!   BEWARE!!!  Don't waste your money or buy into the sales pitch!!!  Rather than wasting my energy and time trying to get the company to do the right thing, I've learned sharing my experience is far more beneficial if it saves someone else from being tricked into buying a Tempur-pedic mattress that is less impressive than a $500 floor model mattress at a local furniture store.",1.0,Tempur-Pedic

But when you lay down evenly the bed is firm and conforms to every curve of your body PERFECTLY. I am 150 Pounds and my boyfriend is about 290, that being said he loves this bed just as much as I do. After research I was a little concerned that the weight difference may cause him to dislike this bed, but it has not. I have notice the last week since sleeping on this mattress that may boyfriend stopped SNORING!! I believe this bed conforms to every curve of your body  instead of your body fighting a normal mattress with springs that it not as conforming, you are coddled into the perfect position. At first I slept so well and did not move that I actually woke-up stiff from sleeping so hard, and even after getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night I was asleep within minutes of returning to bed. Also when I get out of the bed my boyfriend doesn't even know I have gotten up, and VICE VERSA! This bed is great for stomach, side and back sleepers, any way you move on this bed you will be snug! I recommend this bed to anyone, if you are still unsure I have read reviews that there is also a great return policy from amazon, IF some how you do not like this bed. Also we had unrolled the bed on our platform frame around 11 AM and it was completely inflated within 15 minutes. However, we did not sleep on it until 11PM just to give it time! Also I have read reviews about the smell but I had not noticed any over powering smell. I also got the 2.0 2019 model which did not seem to have great reviews, but I do not understand why others do not love this bed? Buying a bed online was a little nerve wracking, but it was more than worth it. But I promise just try it for yourself and you will not be disappointed. Sleeping next to a non-snoring boyfriend has been almost as amazing as this bed! No Complains only thanks to classic brands for making this amazing bed that was actually cheaper then anything we ha looked at in the stores! Plus it was accompanied by no hassle due to the mattress coming rolled up tightly in a box. Normally people only report if they have complaints about a bed, but just know I came back after a week of having this bed and wanted to reassure others that this bed is worth it! So if you are thinking about doing it just go for it! I really think the only people who would dislike this bed are maybe individuals who have issues getting out of bed as its very conforming to the body, or if you like sleeping on a bed that is VERY FIRM and similar to a hardwood floor.",5.0,classic brands

             Style Name: 2019 Model Medium-Plush Mattress The Feel This plush mattress is all about plush comfort. At the surface, a 1 inch layer of bamboo charcoal infused memory foam is quilted into the cover. Bamboo charcoal is especially good for sensitive skin and has improved thermal regulation. Beneath the top layer is a 3 inch layer of ventilated, gel infused memory foam. This layer helps improve breathability and temperature for a more comfortable sleep climate. Beneath the comfort layers, this mattress has a 10 inch high density foam base for excellent support. The top memory foam layers contour to your natural curves during the night and add plushness to the surface. The memory foam also helps to isolate motion transfer between sleeping partners. All LUCID memory foam is created using open cell technology. This prevents lasting body impressions and creates a more durable foam. Soft, Breathable Cover Made of a cozy TENCEL blend fabric (10 percent TENCEL lyocell, 90 percent polyester), the soft cover creates a breathable air layer at the top of the mattress. Conveniently Shipped for Easy Set Up After your new mattress arrives, simply take the package into the right room, remove it from the box and protective wrap, and watch as it expands. No more tossing and turning thanks to dual memory foam layers","My mattress was purchased just over 2 months ago. It has since lost its form and support on one side only. I reached out to customer support and was asked for a detailed group of photos showing the areas of concern with the bed. I submitted all photos that were asked for and received a reply that my bed frame is not what their mattress was intended for and has voided my 10 year warranty. This statement is 100% only untrue but I supplied proof from a manufacturers reply that my frame is ""Ok to use"". In no way at all does the purchase page say anything about the mattress being made for a specific frame style and no others. In fact, the manufacturer states several styles that you can use. Cara, the representative, keeps replying that my claim is not one that they can process under warranty and there is nothing they can do. While I am sure that the mattresses are wonderful when they retain their support, I STRONGLY urge against doing any business with Lucid.

             Style: Cool Gel 1.0 Mattress Only The latest in memory foam and gel technology, Classic Brands 10-Inch Cool Gel Mattress draws heat away from your body so that you stay comfortable at night without tossing and turning. Gel particles are infused throughout the memory foam to help regulate mattress temperature and the memory foam conforms to your body reducing pressure points in any sleeping position and properly aligns the spine. The Classic Brands Cool Gel Mattress has Gel-Infused Memory Foam and is designed for the ultimate in comfort and support. Starting with breathable 2-inch Cool Gel memory foam, this layer disperses body heat and creates a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Two 1-inch layers of Poly Gel-Supportive Foam provides support for the Gel Foam layer. The 6.5-inch support base layer maintains the strength and effectiveness of all three layers. Covered with a beautifully detailed knit top and charcoal-grey knit sides for breathability, the four-way stretch conforms to your body for comfort working with the top layer of gel memory foam to optimize its contouring properties. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a cooler sleeping surface. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

             Color: 6 Inch Treat your guests to a heavenly snooze with this 6x30x74 inch foam mattress. Our durable, flexible mattress provides all the support and comfort needed for a good night’s rest, while being lightweight and firm. This 6 inch foam mattress is perfect for cots, daybeds, guest beds, roll out trundles, RV bunks, futons, on top of a frame extender, camping, or even for on the floor sleepovers! Made with 3 pounds of high density foam, this Fortnight mattress, has a firm feel that is not too hard and not too soft! For your safety, our foam is always made in the US and is CertiPur-US certified, so it contains no PBDEs, TDCPP or TCEP (""Tris"") flame retardants, ozone depleters, mercury, formaldehyde, lead and heavy metals. Why Foam?: Foam mattresses are known for their supportive construction. Being firmer than a traditional mattress, they are suitable for those who suffer from back pain and other related issues. A soft mattress will provide no support and can make you feel uncomfortable. If you’re looking to avoid the “sunk in” feeling of a memory foam mattress, the compact construction of this foam mattress will bounce back after applying pressure. Before Ordering: Accurate measurements of your bed frame are vital to ensure your new mattress fits precisely. The firm structure of our high-density foam mattresses are perfect for those with a heavier build. We recommend that those who have a heavier build purchase a 4 inch or thicker mattress to ensure the most restful and comfortable sleep is achievable. Setup: Mattress comes conveniently right to your door in a box! They are compressed and rolled in a box so it’s easy to transport and set up. After your mattress arrives, simply remove it from the box and remove the plastic, being careful not to cut into the mattress.

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

For your safety, our foam is always made in the US and is CertiPur-US certified, so it contains no PBDEs, TDCPP or TCEP (""Tris"") flame retardants, ozone depleters, mercury, formaldehyde, lead and heavy metals. Why Foam?: Foam mattresses are known for their supportive construction. Being firmer than a traditional mattress, they are suitable for those who suffer from back pain and other related issues. A soft mattress will provide no support and can make you feel uncomfortable. If you’re looking to avoid the “sunk in” feeling of a memory foam mattress, the compact construction of this foam mattress will bounce back after applying pressure. Before Ordering: Accurate measurements of your bed frame are vital to ensure your new mattress fits precisely. The firm structure of our high-density foam mattresses are perfect for those with a heavier build. We recommend that those who have a heavier build purchase a 4 inch or thicker mattress to ensure the most restful and comfortable sleep is achievable. Setup: Mattress comes conveniently right to your door in a box! They are compressed and rolled in a box so it’s easy to transport and set up. After your mattress arrives, simply remove it from the box and remove the plastic, being careful not to cut into the mattress. Allow 24-48 hours for your new mattress to decompress and return to its original plush shape.",I needed something for my grandsons to sleep on.

I researched the crap out of beds for many moons and feel to have gotten quite a value for this product-180$ total after taxes. I was sore after the first night and had my doubts about this queen-sized mattress. The morning of the second night, I woke up dizzy, like woozy, but so sleepy and still a bit sore on my shoulder and hips (my last bed wasn't this firm, but close to it); the third night my body acclimated and now it's perfect for both of us (hubby had no soreness at all, but I tend to have greater and widespread chronic pain symptoms) Altogether we culmulatively weight about 300 lbs and are tall; this bed is long enough for us, but after measuring it's only 76 inches long and 59 inches wide at the foot of the bed. Shouldn't it be 80x60. Definitely getting stars off for that false advertising. Dislikes: kinda needs a pillow top to make it a bit more stable with two people and to not feel the springs at all. The foot of the bed seemed to have a slight dip in the center. It never got inflated I noticed, but my partner said there was no deviation seen. We disagreed. I didn't have the measuring tape, as I do now. The edges of the bed are medium not firm, so you can slope you off the bed, if you have a bed hogger or slippery sheets. At any rate, I waited 72 hours to sleep on it, and it never evened out, so I placed the dip at the foot of the bed instead of the head, put a blanket over it and called it good. It's a half-week shy of a month I've been sleeping on this bed. I'll update this if anything goes awry. Besides the length of the queen-bed being a lie, the bed is comfortable enough for us for now, both of us with high pain.",2.0,classic brands

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment.

The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment.

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

             Style: Cool Gel 1.0 Mattress Only The latest in memory foam and gel technology, Classic Brands 10-Inch Cool Gel Mattress draws heat away from your body so that you stay comfortable at night without tossing and turning. Gel particles are infused throughout the memory foam to help regulate mattress temperature and the memory foam conforms to your body reducing pressure points in any sleeping position and properly aligns the spine. The Classic Brands Cool Gel Mattress has Gel-Infused Memory Foam and is designed for the ultimate in comfort and support. Starting with breathable 2-inch Cool Gel memory foam, this layer disperses body heat and creates a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Two 1-inch layers of Poly Gel-Supportive Foam provides support for the Gel Foam layer. The 6.5-inch support base layer maintains the strength and effectiveness of all three layers. Covered with a beautifully detailed knit top and charcoal-grey knit sides for breathability, the four-way stretch conforms to your body for comfort working with the top layer of gel memory foam to optimize its contouring properties. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a cooler sleeping surface. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size.

It comes in a box, and is kind of heavy. Once we took it out of the box and unrolled it, it took minutes to ""inflate"". I do not feel like it gets too hot and I also like the firmness of it. It's pretty much right in the middle (in my opinion). I don't sink in to the point where it's uncomfortable to move around, but it also adapts to the curvature of my body when I lay down, giving great support.

             Style: Quilted Cover You want a mattress that provides head-to-toe comfort, while also keeping your body properly aligned, fully supported and at a comfortable temperature. And that's just for starters. You also need to be able to sleep deeply, through anything – because last night, a dog was barking at invisible squirrels and tonight, your noisy neighbors are having a late-night party – and tomorrow night, who knows?.","Two years ago we stayed with our son, who had one of these mattresses in his guest room. I found it to be very comfortable and when my bed at home finally needed to be replaced I had no problem picking the Shilo. When it arrived it was very easy to set up but when I laid down it was extremely firm. I thought maybe it needed to relax a bit and didn’t worry. Unfortunately the mattress never did relax and is extremely firm. Considering that the information about the bed is that it is “medium”, the company should change their rating. If I could shove this thing back into the box and return it I would. My shoulders ache all night long and now I have a distressing tingling feeling in both my hands. I made an appointment with my doctor about that because the tingling isn’t going away. I put a topper on the bed and at this point I am still sleeping on it. If my doctor tells me to get rid of the mattress I guess I am out the cost of the bed. Only get this mattress is you prefer a very firm bed. I don’t know if the company changed how they made the mattress but it isn’t at all the same feel as the one my son had. I am very disappointed. Update. After having this mattress for a few months now, I am still very unhappy with it. The mattress is in our spare room. Since my husband had a health issue he goes to bed much earlier now. After he is tucked in, I go to the spare room to read. I typically stay there for 2 or 3 hours before joining my husband in our king bed. The Shilo bed is getting a trough in it, even though I turned it, and don’t sleep in it. I move from side to side while reading and the bed has become lumpy. I am truly disappointed in the Shilo mattress.",2.0,sleep innovations

Coming from a hater of memory foam, I truly love this mattress. It's much firmer than I'm used to, but still extremely comfortable. It doesn't suck you into a massive you-shaped hole like most foam mattresses seem to do, but cushions in the appropriate spots and actually lets you get out of the bed. The cooling gel seems pretty effective: it's summer and I occasionally wake up toasty, but that has more to do with sleeping with a comforter than the actual mattress. Overall, I recommend this mattress provided that the features it comes with appeal to you. My sister tried it (she's used to the ""sink into"" memory foam) and she absolutely hated it. I think if you're looking for a firmer mattress with less insulated heat (my sister's always cold, so she probably prefers the warmer mattress), this one could be for you.",5.0,sweetnight

             Style Name: 6-Inch Cool Gel Mattress The Classic Brands Cool Gel 6-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air is able to travel throughout the material and actually dissipate body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally antimicrobial and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be. Twin Size - 39"" W x 75"" L x 6"" H Twin XL Size - 39"" W x 80"" L x 6"" H Full Size - 54"" W x 75"" L x 6"" H Queen Size – 60"" W x 80"" L x 6"" H Classic Brands Smart Packaging Classic Brands also uses Smart Packaging. Smart packaging reduces the carbon footprint in the manufacturers shipping process. Our advanced packaging technology means we can roll-pack our mattresses and ship them at one-third of the normal size.

Benefits of Memory Foam A memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. This can allow the spine to stay in a neutral position. Should you move during the night, your partner is never disturbed due to the lack of reciprocal movement between sleeping partners. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every part of your body. This next generation of memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam, meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby it is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air can travel throughout the material and dissipate body heat regulating your body temperature. Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Individually Wrapped Coil Support Base The support base in our hybrid mattresses consists of innerspring individual coils wrapped in a fabric designed to minimize friction and maximize support. The 13-gauge steel coils tend to provide consistent distribution of support throughout the mattress and lessens motion transfer and disturbance between sleep partners. The 6-inch individually wrapped innerspring coils are encased in separate pockets, so they can contour precisely to your body. Individually wrapped coil innersprings move independently and reduce the sensation of movement on a bed, providing contouring comfort and support without tossing and turning. CertiPUR-US Certified The foam in Classic Brands Decker 10.5-Inch Hybrid Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress is CertiPUR-US certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis, and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

             Style Name: 8"" Cool Gel Mattress Only Classic Brands Ventilated 8-inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is the latest technology in memory foam mattresses. One layer of 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam draws heat away from your body and allows breathability. The second layer beneath consists of 6 inches of high-density memory foam that conforms to your body providing support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment for a great night's sleep. Perfect for kid’s rooms, college dorms, and guest rooms, this mattress is a great value for any room in the house. The Cool Gel 8-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress and it’s adjustable base friendly. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern.

For starters all Ashley-Sleep mattresses are designed to be no flip—now isn’t that a relief!|How to Care for Your Mattress:|To help keep your Ashley-Sleep mattress clean a thin mattress protector is recommended so it breathes to allow airflow and heat dissipation. Ashley-Sleep does not recommend you use a quilted mattress pad as it will change the feel of the mattress you selected at the store. It may also trap heat that needs to escape.|Don’t use dry cleaning fluid of any type on your mattress. These chemicals could damage some of the comfort and upholstery materials.|Vacuuming is the only recommended cleaning method. If you must clean a stain use mild soap with cold water and apply lightly allowing the mattress time to fully air dry.|Please remind the kids not to jump on their Ashley-Sleep mattress as doing so can break down the inner construction and materials.","This is a very bad mattress.

             Style: Mattress Only For a upgrade to the basic mattress, the LINENSPA 5 Inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress offers the benefits of memory foam and firm support. A comfort layer at the surface features a 1 inch layer of gel infused memory foam that compresses to hug curves and alleviate pressure. Infusing the memory foam with gel material helps to distribute heat to maintain a comfortable temperature. Beneath the comfort layer, a 4 inch layer of high density support foam offers the support you need to wake up refreshed. This mattress has a low profile, so it is a perfect fit for bunk beds and trundle beds. It has a soft, breathable fabric cover and comes with a 10-year warranty from the manufacturer.","We bought this mattress as a floor bed for our 18 month old who had previously been sleeping on the floor. We chose this specific mattress because of the 5 inch thickness which allows him to have comfort and support while also not being far off the floor as he rolls all over the place at night (hence the lack of crib or structured bed). With that being said, we did not use slats, box springs, or a bed frame for this mattress. It is legit on the floor with nothing else other than blankets. Last night was our son’s first night sleeping on the Linenspa and either his monitor coincidentally stopped working or he did not wake up at all throughout the night which is unusual. I laid down with him at the beginning of the night and the mattress was very comfortable. When I rolled away to sneak out, I did not disturb him at all because my movement did not distribute throughout the mattress like with some; definitely a bonus!! The mattress arrived in a box and tightly sealed in thick plastic. We removed both layers of plastic and there was a sort of hissing sound that lasted several minutes. We gave the mattress the entire 48 hours to fluff up in a spare bedroom. There was a definite scent, chemical for lack of a better description. I did not smell lavender as another review mentioned. Once the mattress was in my son’s room, the smell was gone; thankfully so because it probably would have given me a headache had it not been on the opposite side of my house. If we didn’t have a new mattress on our adult bed, I would totally buy another Linenspa. I would say the only downfall to having a thinner mattress is normal sheets don’t fit tightly. I have not searched for sheets specific to thinner mattresses so they might exists. I definitely recommend this mattress. We hope our son can use it as he grows so we’ll see how it holds up!",5.0,linenspa

The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size.

             Style Name: 8"" Cool Gel Mattress Only Classic Brands Ventilated 8-inch Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress is the latest technology in memory foam mattresses. One layer of 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam draws heat away from your body and allows breathability. The second layer beneath consists of 6 inches of high-density memory foam that conforms to your body providing support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment for a great night's sleep. Perfect for kid’s rooms, college dorms, and guest rooms, this mattress is a great value for any room in the house. The Cool Gel 8-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress and it’s adjustable base friendly. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested.

             Style Name: 6-Inch Cool Gel Mattress The Classic Brands Cool Gel 6-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is medium firm - slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a plusher and cooler sleeping material. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air is able to travel throughout the material and actually dissipate body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally antimicrobial and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

             Style: 2018 Model Product Description From the Manufacturer","We have previous model Queen casper and love it. We ordered the King thinking it was a sure thing and would be exactly the same as the Queen. According to casper they made changes to the mattress since we purchased our original one and the new version is now about “10% softer”. It seems like it’s probably about 70% cheaper to make because the new one offers none of the support that the Queen casper we own does. It’s like night and day. Sitting on the King we just purchased you could feel the slats in the bed frame and it would compress to less than 2” on the side. I wouldn’t reccomend anyone purchase a new model casper, tried to find a first generation but they are out of production. Shame, it was a great company. They did honor the return policy though.",1.0,casper

             Style Name: 14-Inch Mattress Classic Brands Gramercy Euro-Top Cool Gel Memory Foam and Innerspring 14-Inch Mattress combines the superior support of a wrapped-coil innerspring system with the conforming response of gel-infused memory foam for the ultimate sleeping experience. Featuring a beautifully detailed quilted euro-top knit cover, corded edges, and coordinating knit side panels for breathability, this quality mattress is an excellent value. Wrapped coils prevent motion transfer between partners and the gel-infused memory foam layer draws heat away from the body allowing you to wake up more refreshed and feeling great. The 14- inch profile Gramercy Hybrid Gel Memory Foam Innerspring Mattress combines the support of a wrapped steel coil innersprings with the conforming response of gel memory foam. The box-top layers consist of 1-inch layer of gel infused memory foam that disperses body heat, 0.25 inch over 0.5 inch of comfort foam. A second layer of 1-inch Gel Memory Foam which creates a cooler sleeping surface. Two additional layers of 2 inches of comfort foam and .75 inch of comfort foam works with the 8-inch support layer of individually wrapped coils, which are encased in separate pockets, so they can contour precisely to your body. The 13-gauge steel coils tend to provide consistent distribution of support throughout the mattress and lessens motion transfer for sleep partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam, meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby it is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. Gel foam helps regulate temperature throughout the mattress. A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress- free support. This can allow the spine to stay in a neutral position. Should you move during the night, your partner is never disturbed due to the lack of reciprocal movement between sleeping partners. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture. Individually Wrapped Coil Support Base The support base in our hybrid mattresses consists of innerspring individual coils wrapped in a fabric designed to minimize friction and maximize support. The 13-gaugge steel coils tend to provide consistent distribution of support throughout the mattress and lessens motion transfer for sleep partners. An additional layer of 0.75 inch of comfort foam works with the 8-inch support layer of individually wrapped coils, which are encased in separate pockets, so they can contour precisely to your body. Individually wrapped coil innersprings move independently and reduce the sensation of movement on a bed, providing contouring comfort and support for an undisturbed night's sleep.

Caroline comes topped with an open cell layer of air flow memory foam that keeps air moving, while a second layer of gel-infused memory foam further ensures a cool and comfortable night sleep. Caroline is a responsive mattress that dissipates your body heat while quickly conforming to your weight and position. Sleep peacefully with an open cell memory foam solution that relieves pressure points, reduces bounce between two sleepers and delivers welcome relief from the aches and pains of traditional mattresses. Caroline is CertiPUR-US certified by accredited independent testing laboratories so you can be confident that the memory foam is made without formaldehyde, ozone depleters, mercury and other heavy metals, PBDEs, TDCPP or TCEP (”Tris”) flame retardants, and is low on VOC. The mattress comes vacuum-packed and rolled to fit into an easily portable box. It takes 2 to 4 hours for the mattress to expand most of the way and a day to expand fully. Includes a removable stretch cover, gray polyester mesh and a non-slip bottom. Box spring or foundation are optional. Slatted bases should be less than 3"" apart.","I wasn't sure about this mattress when I ordered it, because unlike Casper or Sealy, etc., Modway isn't a household name. However, it is like other good quality foam mattresses I've tried.  It's medium-firm, a little squishy but with very solid back support for side and back sleepers.  It's 12 inches tall, and thus provides even more support than thinner mattresses.  It's compatible with boxsprings as well as close slats or platforms. Foam mattresses are recommended by some doctors who treat back pain over traditional innerspring mattresses due to the better support. I think the claim of superior support is true, especially if you are someone who usually tosses and turns during the night or is affected by the movements of your partner. It's best to have two people to help set it up.  You will want to get your old mattress out of the way first, then tip the still-rolled-up-burrito new mattress onto your boxspring.  Then follow the instructions and cut the plastic carefully with scissors to unroll. I unrolled this mattress in the afternoon and by the evening it was almost completely expanded to its intended size and height. I didn't experience much off-gassing.  On the first day there was only a mild off-gassing odor only when my nose was very close to the mattress, and by second day, it had almost entirely dissipated. It is warmer to sleep on than an innerspring because the memory foam kind of hugs you, but I expect that will be nice during the winter months and manageable during the summer.  Like all memory foam mattresses, there isn't as much edge support as innersprings, and the corners of the mattress aren't as rigid, so fitted sheets may need some readjusting now and then.  These are minor drawbacks. This mattress doesn't come with ""white-glove"" delivery by a person.  The advantage is that you don't have to rearrange your schedule waiting for delivery, but the drawback is that you've got to get rid of the old mattress yourself.  If you're lucked out with your residential area, you may have curbside pickup on some days, but check with your local DPW's website. There are also many mattress removal businesses online to get quotes from.",4.0,modway

I'm a side sleeper and the comfort level of the upper plush layer and inner-support work perfectly.  Most other memory foam mattresses have a deep sinking feel that I would avoid - this mattress is soft-to-medium type of firm level that has sufficient support to allow laying down, sitting bed-side, and rolling around without disturbing movement across the entire bed.  If you're single person, you'll need to switch sides from time to time to ""break-in"" the comfort evenly on both sides - but it's no issue and gradually evens out easily.

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually.

             Style Name: 10-Inch Mattress Only Classic Brands Decker Firm Hybrid Memory Foam and Innerspring 10.5-Inch Mattress is the newest technology in bedding-combining the traditional innerspring coils with the newest generation of memory foam to provide the ultimate sleep experience. Progressive memory foam layers conform precisely to your body while the wrapped innerspring coils move independently providing comfort and support for an undisturbed night's sleep. The 10.5-inch profile Decker Hybrid Memory Foam Innerspring Mattress combines the support of a wrapped steel coil innerspring with the conforming response of memory foam. The 1- inch top layer consists of breathable open-cell memory foam that conforms to your shape. A second layer of 1-inch comfort foam and a third layer of 2-inch comfort foam works with the support layer providing you with the ultimate sleeping experience. The 6-inch individually wrapped coils are encased in separate pockets which enables the coils to move independently and reduce the sensation of movement on a bed providing contouring comfort and support for an uninterrupted night’s sleep. Covered with a beautifully detailed quilted knit cover with a corded edge and coordinating knit sides for breathability. Benefits of Memory Foam A memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. This can allow the spine to stay in a neutral position. Should you move during the night, your partner is never disturbed due to the lack of reciprocal movement between sleeping partners. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every part of your body. This next generation of memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam, meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby it is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air can travel throughout the material and dissipate body heat regulating your body temperature. Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Individually Wrapped Coil Support Base The support base in our hybrid mattresses consists of innerspring individual coils wrapped in a fabric designed to minimize friction and maximize support. The 13-gauge steel coils tend to provide consistent distribution of support throughout the mattress and lessens motion transfer and disturbance between sleep partners. The 6-inch individually wrapped innerspring coils are encased in separate pockets, so they can contour precisely to your body. Individually wrapped coil innersprings move independently and reduce the sensation of movement on a bed, providing contouring comfort and support without tossing and turning. CertiPUR-US Certified The foam in Classic Brands Decker 10.5-Inch Hybrid Memory Foam and Innerspring Mattress is CertiPUR-US certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis, and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

I myself am in my 60s and with a lot of will got the bed setup by myself and unwrapped. Not an easy feat mind you.  I had read there is a slight smell and was ready for that. But it's not slight for me, it's very powerful but not chemical type smells which trigger immediate headaches this does not cause headaches or dizziness so I guess it's more of a natural smell.  So today is day two of leaving all bedroom windows open while I sleep in my living room. I will update this review when I can actually sleep in my room on the bed.  I did lay on it and it feels so soft and heavenly.  I have arthritis all over so that is why I wanted a new bed my old bed is firm and I hurt.  I am sure this will be much better for my aching body.

Engineered with zones of support, Posturepedic Technology pairs state-of-the-art engineering with the highest quality materials to target the right level of support for each area of the body, resulting in exceptional all-over comfort.","I actually have the Sealy Posturpedic Azario which was replaced (in name) by the Carsten which was replaced by the Manor Place  which was replaced by the Buckingham. and then renamed the Response. I bought mine 6 years ago, and it's had 4 name changes (to hide the negative reviews maybe?) But the construction is the same. gel foam, good edges  plush but not pillow top. I think the main difference is this one possibly has individual coils where the one 6 years ago is just the linked innerspring. so here's my review of the mattress that you will see in 6 years. So it has a 10 year warranty, right? Good luck in cashing in on it. Our bed, the padding/batting whatever that is above the springs has compressed to the point that there is a tall hill between where my husband and i sleep. rolling over to the other side of the bed is literally climbing a hill... and it's been like this since year 4. Once our backs/hips started hurting, (around year 4) we added on a 2"" mattress topper. That did ease the pain, but eventually the compression started hurting us again. We tried a 4"" mattress topper and it was too deep - so went to a 3"". We stayed there for a year, and about 6 months ago, tried the mattress by itself, (about 5.5 years into purchase). The hill between us made cuddling/snuggling impossible and we both woke up with hip pain and back pain. (both side sleepers) Finally we decided to try for the warranty - its only been a bit over 6 years, surely a 10 year warranty means something, right? Wrong. So the batting at the top under the quilting is like quilt batting - it fluffs back up immediately upon removal of weight. So my bed... LOOKS flat as a pancake - well i could possibly get a 1/2 inch reading -. while the body impressions are deep enough to drown a person. And guess what? You cannot claim a cent on the warranty without physical proof that there is a 1 1/2 inch depression in the appearance of the mattress with nothing on it. heck, the whole bottom could be missing but as long as the top looks flat, you are out of luck! So i looked into reviews of other sealy owners on other sites - hundreds of complaints about jumping through hoops only to be completely stuck at the end. months of sending in paperwork to have more pictures requested, then more pictures, then videos. I did start the process.. step 1 seemed really easy. submit. Wow that was great! then I got the first email. wow. requesting specific pics - which i know arent going to show what they deem necessary - and many of them! and pics of the FRAME and the box springs too. huh? well i know that my flat looking mattress isn't going to give me back anything, so I gave up - as I'm sure their intention is - after step 1. I have a completely painful, unusable mattress with 4 years left on the warranty... and i have zero  recourse. If you buy a sealy plush mattress from anywhere.... be aware, the 10 year warranty means NOTHING. and you will usually get only about 3-4 years out of it. just be aware of that when you price them.",1.0,sealy

Care instruction: To help keep your Ashley-Sleep mattress clean, a thin mattress protector is recommended so it breathes to allow airflow and heat dissipation. Ashley-Sleep does not recommend you use a quilted mattress pad as it will change the feel of the mattress you selected at the store. It may also trap heat that needs to escape.

If you must clean a stain, use mild soap with cold water and apply lightly, allowing the mattress time to fully air dry.

             Style: Memory Foam Mattress Only Good mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. The Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep. The feel of this gel memory foam mattress is slightly plusher than a traditional firm mattress. Why Choose Vibe The Vibe mattress is comprised of gel memory foam which supports every part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam automatically adjusts to your body’s weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, Vibe offers complete, luxurious, and stress-free support. This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam The latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete. A combination of 2 inches of gel memory foam with 3 inches of gel comfort foam provides the ultimate in breathability and heat displacement while 7 inches of high-density base foam beneath offers maximum support, pressure point relief, and proper spinal alignment. All this surrounded by a luxurious stretch knit cover, you may never want to leave your bed. Low-Cost Quality Solution for Good Sleep The Vibe Mattress is a low-cost solution to more expensive branded memory foam beds and is a smart alternative without sacrificing quality, comfort, or support. Get it Right the First Time It is also a good idea to know the size and the height of your mattress ahead of time to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get a gauge of the how tall your sleep system will be.

MADE IN THE USA.","I've owned and slept on this mattress nearly every day for 6 years (purchased in 2012 and this review is in 2018). Overall I'm really happy with it. The cover started to tear and come apart at year 2 and by year 3 I just cut it off since it was getting ratty. The cover is really thin and flimsy. I've had no problems using it without its cover, but I can see some nasty looking glue surrounding the outside of the mattress (maybe to hold the layers together?). I hate staying at hotels because their mattresses are never as good as this one at home. It sleeps a little hot but I like that. I don't find myself sweating in it and I like that it keeps me warm at night when my body temperature drops. Durability (besides the cover) has been excellent. I haven't worn a rut in the area I normally sleep. It only has slightly more give than the surroundings. I don't even notice it unless I try. Haven't noticed any other degradation. I would call this mattress medium-firm. I'm a combo sleeper (mostly side and stomach) and it's a tiny bit too firm for side sleeping and sometimes hurts my shoulder. It's really not that bad, though. I wish it was a little softe. I've also noticed that the mattress' responsiveness/firmness changes with temperature. Sometimes when I got on vacation I set my thermostat to 50F and when I come back the mattress feels totally different. Almost like a soft brick. Once it heats back up it feels normal. I guess this makes sense but it's something I found odd the first time it happened. When I first bought this it had only like 30 reviews and it felt like I was taking a big risk. I think it paid off. I was looking through my Amazon history and I can't believe they still sell this. With some no brand mattress I was expecting it to disappear from Amazon in a few months and have it disintegrate soon after. It's still here and for good reason. I like it.",4.0,made in the usa

34572,"Mattress America Revive Gel Memory Foam Mattress, 12"" H, Queen",01 May 2020,,"I have now had this bed for 2 weeks, and I can definitely say I am happy with this purchase so far! Usually when I wake up my entire body is sore (I had a terribly old and uncomfortable spring mattress before), and that has not happened since sleeping on this bed! I would definitely describe the feel as medium, not too soft or too firm.  When I received the package, I was a little worried at first because the outer box was split open, but thankfully the inside packaging was not affected.  Like other reviews, I recommend letting the mattress decompress without the protector- for the first hour I didn’t, and I could see the corners we’re not expanding correctly. My only negative is it only expanded to 11” after leaving it alone to decompress on a flat surface for 72 hrs. However, I’m still rating this 5 stars since it is amazing otherwise!",5.0,

             Style: Cool Gel 1.0 Mattress Only The latest in memory foam and gel technology, Classic Brands 10-Inch Cool Gel Mattress draws heat away from your body so that you stay comfortable at night without tossing and turning. Gel particles are infused throughout the memory foam to help regulate mattress temperature and the memory foam conforms to your body reducing pressure points in any sleeping position and properly aligns the spine. The Classic Brands Cool Gel Mattress has Gel-Infused Memory Foam and is designed for the ultimate in comfort and support. Starting with breathable 2-inch Cool Gel memory foam, this layer disperses body heat and creates a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Two 1-inch layers of Poly Gel-Supportive Foam provides support for the Gel Foam layer. The 6.5-inch support base layer maintains the strength and effectiveness of all three layers. Covered with a beautifully detailed knit top and charcoal-grey knit sides for breathability, the four-way stretch conforms to your body for comfort working with the top layer of gel memory foam to optimize its contouring properties. Benefits of Gel Memory Foam A gel memory foam mattress can support each part of the body evenly and individually. Gel Memory foam slowly and automatically adjusts to your body weight and temperature. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Additionally, when you do move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture, cradling every contour of your body. The Latest Gel Memory Foam Technology Gel Memory Foam is a unique material that infuses gel particles into visco-elastic memory foam, creating a cooler sleeping surface. Gel memory foam is more porous or open than conventional foam meaning the cells are interconnected unlike closed cell foam; thereby is more breathable and comfortable than higher density visco-elastic foam. The open-celled physical structure of our foams is self-ventilating. Air travels throughout the material and dissipates body heat regulating your body temperature. Gel Memory foam is naturally hypoallergenic and resistant to allergens, mold, bacteria and dust mites. Why Buy a Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress? Cool Gel mattresses with gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler sleeping surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. Tossing and turning are dramatically diminished and disrupted sleep patterns are greatly eliminated so you can sleep longer without moving and enjoy the benefits of a deeper, more restful sleep pattern. CertiPUR-US Certified Classic Brands gel memory foam mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. The CertiPUR-US program is a voluntary testing, analysis and certification program for flexible polyurethane foam used as a cushioning material in home furnishings such as adult mattresses, crib mattresses, upholstered furniture and some accessory comfort products. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested.

I ordered a double sized mattress, all I ordered was the mattress because I already had a double bed.  When the mattress arrived, I took it out of the box and laid it on my existing double box spring.  Initially, the mattress looked much smaller than the box spring, after waiting for the mattress to expand, it was still much smaller than the double box spring I already have.
